## Overview

**NEAR AI** enables scalable, decentralized AI systems where agents can communicate, store data, and run in secure, trust-minimized environments. Here, you’ll find conceptual guides, tutorials, cookbook examples, and Notebooks that provide both the “why” and the “how” of building AI Agents on NEAR.
